## [v0.1.0] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Yahoo Finance API reliability** — upgraded `User-Agent` to full Chrome browser string + added `Accept` / `Accept-Language` headers across all Yahoo Finance calls (`fetchDetailedQuotesBatch`, `fetchHistory`, `fetchQuotes`). Previously the minimal `"Mozilla/5.0"` string was blocked by Yahoo from cloud IPs, causing Compare and Screener to error.
- **query2 retry fallback** — `fetchDetailedQuotesBatch` and `fetchHistory` now retry on `query2.finance.yahoo.com` when `query1` fails. This handles Yahoo's intermittent IP-based blocking.
- **Compare page ERROR state** — `getStockDetailController` now checks the MongoDB stocks cache first (before hitting Yahoo Finance), eliminating unnecessary API calls and returning data instantly for recently-loaded tickers. Previously it always called Yahoo first.
- **F and GM showing ERROR in Compare** — `F` (Ford) and `GM` (General Motors) were in the tracked US symbol list but not in the static fallback data. Added them (and GOOGL, META, JPM, BAC, GS, COIN, PLTR) to the static fallback so the final safety net is comprehensive.
- **Removed unused `env` import** in `market.controller.ts`.

### Added
- **Expanded static fallback data** — 14 US tickers (was 8) covering the full Compare preset list.
